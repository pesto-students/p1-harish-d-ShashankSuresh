        React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for
        React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching,
        synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a
        breeze.

        Out of the box, React applications do not come with an opinionated way
        of fetching or updating data from your components so developers end up
        building their own ways of fetching data. This usually means cobbling
        together component-based state and effect using React hooks, or using
        more general purpose state management libraries to store and provide
        asynchronous data throughout their apps. React Query allows you to
        defeat and overcome the tricky challenges and hurdles of server state
        and control your app data before it starts to control you.

        If you're not overwhelmed by that list, then that must mean that you've
        probably solved all of your server state problems already and deserve an
        award. However, if you are like a vast majority of people, you either
        have yet to tackle all or most of these challenges and we're only
        scratching the surface!
